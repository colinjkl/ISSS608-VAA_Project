# Introduction

Paragraph describing climate change and how it is a pressing issue

# Problems

The list of exact issues we are trying to find. For example:

1.  Media outlets often use misleading numbers for publicity purposes. Averages or outlying numbers do not tell the whole story

2.  Singapore may be a small country but even so different parts are subjected to varying weather conditions

3.  Time of the year is also a big factor when talking about climate impact

We aim to develop an app that can inform the community about temperature/weather trends effortlessly with eye-catching and interactive visualizations.

# Data

description of our data sources

# Methodology

## EDA

We will be using data visualizations to explore trends in our weather and temperature for the past few decades

## Forecast

We will be using time-series analysis to forecast temperature changes in the near future. In addition, sensitivity analysis will be used to address the uncertainties in the forecast.
