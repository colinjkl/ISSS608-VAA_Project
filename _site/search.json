Here, each line (and color) represents a different weather station. We can also added the vertical histograms that shows the distribution as well as the outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Impact\nIn this section, the users will be able to visualize the correlation between temp/rain and dengue cases. Those who are in the public health sector can make use of this information to develop better strategies to prevent dengue outbreak."

It will act as the reference model to be compared with more advanced models.\nHolt Winter’s method which employs exponential smoothing techniques that applies a higher weightage to the more recent data. The underlying assumption here is that the weather in the recent years would be more valuable in forecasting the future weather.\nSeasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) which extends auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods by adding the seasonality component. The underlying assumption here is that weather exhibits seasonality trend. Thus, SARIMA method would be more suitable for weather forecasting."

It measures how far the forecasted values are deviated from the actual measurements.\n\nMean absolute percentage error (MAPE) which measures the percentage error against the actual measurements. It’s largely adopted because it’s normalized in percentage form, which many people find it easier to interpret and compare among different methods."
