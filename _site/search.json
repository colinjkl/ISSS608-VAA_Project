Here, each line (and color) represents a different weather station. We can also added the vertical histograms that shows the distribution as well as the outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Impact\nIn this section, the users will be able to visualize the correlation between temp/rain and dengue cases. Those who are in the public health sector can make use of this information to develop better strategies to prevent dengue outbreak."

The underlying assumption here is that the weather in the recent years would be more valuable in forecasting the future weather.\nSeasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) which extends auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods by adding the seasonality component. The underlying assumption here is that weather exhibits seasonality trend. Thus, SARIMA method would be more suitable for weather forecasting."

It measures how far the forecasted values are deviated from the actual measurements.\n\nMean absolute percentage error (MAPE) which measures the percentage error against the actual measurements.

Below are some of the aspects that can be explored with that dataset.\nSingapore Climate\nData: Meteorological Service Singapore daily weather data\nEDA:\n\nVisualize changes in weather conditions in Singapore over past few years.\nVisualize factors contributing to climate change (need more data for other sources)\nVisualize impacts of climate change (need more data for other sources)\n\nRshiny:\n\nForecast temperature/rainfall with time-series analysis\nPredict temperature using attribution modelling or other machine learning techniques like random forest/gradient boosting\n\nHDB Pricing\nData: HDB, Singstats\nEDA:\n\nVisualize historical patterns in HDB prices\nVisualize differences in prices by region and time\n\nRshiny:\n\nPredict prices of HDB given some known factors\n\nAll 3 agreed to go with weather data for our project. The actual scope will be decided in later meetings. We will start the following 2 in proposal and add/remove after consult with prof.\nEDA: Visualize changes in weather conditions in Singapore over past few years by region and time\nRshiny: Forecast temperature/rainfall with time-series analysis\n\n\nRoles Allocation\nColin will start early with web layout. More time is needed here as we are all beginners at html/css/js. Also will create git repo and host on Netlify.\nCi Hui and Yiping will work on drafting the proposal for submission on 11 Feb. We aim to finish by 9th Feb so that we can enjoy our CNY break.\nProposal will be shared in teams shared folder where multiple users can edit the .doc at the same time instead of editing in .qmd which requires multiple branching, pulling and pushing on Git. Once done, it will be copied over to a .qmd file by colin who will push the final proposal to origin.\n\n\nTimeline\nWe discussed about the timeline using an excel sheet. Here is the final screenshot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda for next meeting\n\nFinalize project idea (should be after prof consult)\nModels to deploy on Shiny App (by now, we should all have finish Shiny app tutorials)\nWebsite layout improvements\n\n\n\nAdjournment\nMeeting ended at 8:10pm. Next meeting on 13th February, 8:00pm (Tentative) online."

In the real-world application, the researchers would also use satellite image data to forecast the future weather. However, this requires additional data and specific knowledge to interpret the satellite images. Hence, we’ll keep the project scope simple by just using the data downloaded from the website.\nMeanwhile, prof has reminded us to check the data source carefully before downloading.\n\nCorrelation Study between Weather and Dengue Cases\n\nAs dengue clusters are often isolated to regions with outbreaks, Prof had advised that we look at dengue cases on a national and weekly level. Climate data used will hence also be at the national level, aggregated across all regions in Singapore.\nIn addition, prof suggested that we can use an explanatory model to study the impact of temperature and rainfall on dengue cases. For example, would dengue cases increase when rainfall increases?\n\n\n\nFeedback on Proposal\nCDA\n\nOur idea of CDA in the proposal is incorrect. MAPE and RMSE are measures to check accuracy of model, and are not what CDA is about.\n\nDashboard in ShinyApp\n\nThis is not the focus of the ShinyApp. ShinyApp should focus more on Applications.\n\n\n\nOther advice\n\nProf also shared another potential project idea which is to calibrate a model to interpolate the rainfall at the area without rainfall station. There are a total of 27 rainfall stations in Singapore, but it’s challenging to predict the rainfall at the area outside the rainfall station’s coverage.\nHowever, this requires the knowledge of geospatial interpolation. Hence, we’ll not go into this area for this project\n\n\n\nAgenda for next meeting\n\nData preparations\nModel finalization\n\n\n\nAdjournment\nMeeting ended at 11:40am. Next meeting on 24th February, 4:00pm (Tentative) after class."

The content written for the sections (i.e. introduction, methodology, tools) can be also displayed in the Shiny app.\n\n\nAgenda for next meeting\n\nShiny App progress\nPoster draft design\n\n\n\nAdjournment\nMeeting ended at 4:30pm.
