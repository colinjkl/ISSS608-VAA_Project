<h1>Analysis of Climate Impact on<br>Dengue Cases</h1>

National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) of Singapore reported that<br>

-   Annual mean temperature in Singapore has increased from [26.9°C to 28.0°C]{style="font-size: 20px; color: #FFF3CD"} from 1980 to 2020

-   Annual total rainfall in Singapore has increased at [an average rate of 67mm per decade]{style="font-size: 20px; color: #FFF3CD"} from 1980 to 2019

The climate changes has affected the public health in Singapore such as [more dengue cases are reported during warmer periods]{style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; color: #FFF3CD"} of the year.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<br>

Dengue fever, a disease caused by the dengue virus which is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infective mosquito, poses a significant public health concern in many parts of the world, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The incidence of dengue has been steadily rising, presenting a complex challenge to healthcare systems and communities worldwide.

This project delves into the relationship between dengue fever and environmental conditions, aiming to：

<h1>2023 was Singapore's 4th hottest year on record</h1>

Nearly 20 temperature-related records in Singapore were matched or broken. This included the highest daily temperature of 37 deg C recorded on May 13, 2023, in Ang Mo Kio, which tied with that recorded in Tengah in 1983.

With a mean temperature of 29.5 deg C, May 2023 matched March 1998 for the warmest month on record.
